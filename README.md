# pixelJar

An RGB colour changing lamp, built using an ESP8266 MCU and programmed with Micropython. 

The project was initially housed in a glass jar and used NeoPixel LEDs (hence pixelJar); however, the final implementation was housed inside a plastic Slush Puppy branded cup.

The lamp features a push button in the top of the straw which can be used to cycle through light modes, or held down to go into sleep.

**Please note:** this project was completed while I was still an undergraduate in computer science and was my first attempt at programming an MCU. Therefore this project may not be indicative of current skill level.
